Original source, by [bunnyboy](http://nintendoage.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Users.Home&User=bunnyboy), is [available here](http://www.nespowerpak.com/nesasm/).
The only modifications I made were inclusion of the `Makefile`, which was adapted from the one included with [MagicKit](http://www.magicengine.com/mkit/), and the text files,
which were found in various places in the aforementioned sites and by lots of research/searching on my part.
